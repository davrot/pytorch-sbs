# Python

It was programmed with 3.10.4. And I used some 3.10 Python expression. Thus you might get problems with older Python versions. 

# C++

You need to modify the Makefile in the C++ directory to your Python installation.  

In addition your Python installation needs the PyBind11 package installed. You might want to perform a  
pip install pybind11  
The Makefile uses clang as a compiler. If you want something else then you need to change the Makefile.
For CUDA I used version 12.0.

# Config files and pre-existing weights

Three .json config files are required: 

dataset.json : Information about the dataset

network.json : Describes the network architecture

def.json : Controlls the other parameters 

If you want to load existing weights, just put them in a sub-folder called Previous
