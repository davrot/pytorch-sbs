# Python

It was programmed with 3.10.4. And I used some 3.10 Python expression. Thus you might get problems with older Python versions. 

# C++

It works without compiling the C++ modules. However it is 10x slower.   
You need to modify the Makefile in the C++ directory to your Python installation.  
In addition yoir Python installation needs the PyBind11 package installed. You might want to perform a  
pip install pybind11  
The Makefile uses clang as a compiler. If you want something else then you need to change the Makefile.
The SbS.py autodetectes if the required C++ .so modules are in the same directory as the SbS.py file.
